# Chapter 1 Algorithms

This code demonstrates the following three algorithms.

## Car Cost

Given the following, compute the total cost for two cars and find the cheapest.

 * annual fuel consumed = annual miles driven / fuel efficiency
 * annual fuel cost = price per gallon * annual fuel consumed
 * operating cost = 10 * annual fuel cost
 * total cost = purchase price + operating cost

## Doubling Money

Algorithmically compute how many years it will take to double any given
amount of money with any given annual interest percentage.

## Phone Bill

Under a plan that costs $29.95 per month for 300 minutes of calls, plus $0.45
for every minute over 300, plus 12.5% in taxes and interest fees, calculate
the phone bill for a month having used any given number of minutes.
